The API provides a method of securely uploading additional documentation to support a declaration submission.

This service is used to initiate a file upload as part of the declaration submission process.  An example document you may be requested to upload could be a paper copy of a licence. This endpoint is used to initiate a file upload where a signed URL is returned by the endpoint to be used in the file upload workflow.
